# Hydra_Simulation
## Completed as part of USYD SSP Physics
Simulation of the biomechanics of a Hydra combined with a Multilayer Perceptron motor control brain.

## Usage
1. Clone repository
2. Install python + conda
3. Follow the steps in requirements.txt to install dependencies.
4. run 'python3 viewer.py' to begin the simulation

## Controls
- scroll wheel + mouse click (L/R) to manually activate muscle contractions and elongations
- 'S' to speed simulation
- 'R' to reset simulation
- click on the left array to determine input neuron activation
- 'K' to save input neuron activation, 'L' to load input neuron activation
- 'P' computes and plays muscle activation using the MLP model
